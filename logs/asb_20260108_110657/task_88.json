Conclusion**\nOver the past decade, **Portfolio B (Balanced)** demonstrated the most **efficient risk-return tradeoff**, while **Portfolio C (Aggressive)** offered the highest absolute returns at the cost of greater volatility. **Portfolio A (Conservative)** provided stability and capital preservation, making it suitable for low-risk investors.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to include **visualizations** (e.g., performance charts, risk-return scatter plots, or drawdown curves) to complement this report?\n\nTurn 2: Calling orchestrator...\nOrchestrator decision: delegate_to=tool_user_agent, done=False\nDelegating to tool_user_agent: Generate visualizations (performance charts, risk-return scatter plots, and drawdown curves) to complement the comparative report on historical portfolio performance.\nOutput from tool_user_agent: I can outline and describe the visualizations that would accompany your comparative report.  \nSince I can\u2019t render actual graphics here, I\u2019ll specify how each chart should look, what data to plot, and what insights it should convey.
