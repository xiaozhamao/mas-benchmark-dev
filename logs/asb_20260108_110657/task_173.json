      "content": "Here\u2019s a **comprehensive analysis report** on the effects of currency fluctuations on international investments, formatted in a professional and structured manner:  \n\n---\n\n## **The Effects of Currency Fluctuations on International Investments**\n\n### **1. Theoretical Background: Exchange Rate Movements and Investment Returns**\n\n#### **1.1 Exchange Rate Fundamentals**\nExchange rates represent the value of one currency relative to another and are influenced by macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation, trade balances, and political stability. The two main exchange rate systems are:\n- **Fixed exchange rate systems**, where a currency\u2019s value is pegged to another (e.g., USD or gold).\n- **Floating exchange rate systems**, where market forces determine currency values.\n\n#### **1.2 Impact on Investment Returns**\nFor international investors, returns are affected by both **asset performance** and **currency movements**. The total return on a foreign investment can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nR_{total} = (1 + R_{foreign}) \\times (1 + R_{currency}) - 1\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( R_{foreign} \\) = return on the foreign asset in local currency.\n- \\( R_{currency} \\) = change in the exchange rate between the investor\u2019s home currency and the foreign currency.\n\nA **currency appreciation** relative to the investor\u2019s home currency enhances returns, while a **currency depreciation** reduces them.\n\n#### **1.3 Theoretical Models**\n- **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):** Suggests that exchange rates adjust to equalize the price of identical goods across countries.\n- **Interest Rate Parity (IRP):** States that differences in interest rates between two countries are offset by expected changes in exchange rates.\n- **Balance of Payments Theory:** Links exchange rate movements to trade and capital flows.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Historical Examples of Currency Fluctuations and Investment Performance**\n\n#### **2.1 USD/EUR Exchange Rate**\n- **Early 2000s:** The euro appreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar, rising from around 0.85 USD/EUR in 2001 to over 1.50 USD/EUR by 2008.  \n  - **Impact:** U.S. investors holding European equities benefited from both strong equity performance and favorable currency movements.\n- **2014\u20132016:** The euro weakened from 1.39 to 1.05 USD/EUR due to divergent monetary policies (ECB easing vs. Fed tightening).  \n  - **Impact:** U.S. investors saw reduced returns on European assets, while European investors in U.S. markets gained from a stronger dollar.\n\n#### **2.2 USD/JPY Exchange Rate**\n- **2012\u20132015:** The Japanese yen depreciated sharply from 80 to 125 per USD following aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of Japan.  \n  - **Impact:** Foreign investors in Japanese equities saw strong local returns, but U.S. investors experienced diminished gains when converted back to dollars.\n- **2020\u20132023:** The yen again weakened due to interest rate differentials, affecting global portfolios with Japanese exposure.\n\n#### **2.3 Emerging Market Currencies**\nEmerging market currencies (e.g., Brazilian real, Turkish lira) often exhibit higher volatility. Currency depreciation in these markets can erode returns even when local asset performance is strong, underscoring the importance of currency risk management.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Risk-Adjusted Returns and Hedging Strategies**\n\n#### **3.1 Risk-Adjusted Returns**\nCurrency fluctuations introduce additional volatility into international portfolios. Investors often evaluate performance using **risk-adjusted metrics** such as:\n- **Sharpe Ratio:** Measures excess return per unit of risk.\n- **Sortino Ratio:** Focuses on downside risk.\n- **Value at Risk (VaR):** Estimates potential losses due to adverse currency movements.\n\n#### **3.2 Hedging Strategies**\nTo mitigate currency risk, investors employ various hedging techniques:\n- **Forward Contracts:** Lock in future exchange rates for currency conversion.\n- **Currency Futures and Options:** Provide flexibility to manage exposure with limited upfront cost.\n- **Currency ETFs and Swaps:** Offer diversified or synthetic exposure to currency movements.\n- **Natural Hedging:** Aligning revenues and expenses in the same currency to offset risk.\n\n#### **3.3 Strategic vs. Tactical Hedging**\n- **Strategic Hedging:** Long-term policy to reduce currency exposure systematically.\n- **Tactical Hedging:** Short-term adjustments based on market outlook or macroeconomic conditions.\n\nEmpirical studies show that partial hedging (e.g., 50%) often provides an optimal balance between risk reduction and return potential.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Conclusions: Managing Currency Risk in International Portfolios**\n\n1. **Diversification:** Holding assets across multiple currencies can reduce exposure to any single currency\u2019s volatility.  \n2. **Hedging Policy:** Investors should establish a clear hedging framework aligned with their risk tolerance and investment horizon.  \n3. **Monitoring Macroeconomic Indicators:** Interest rate differentials, inflation trends, and central bank policies are key drivers of exchange rate movements.  \n4. **Dynamic Risk Management:** Regularly reassessing currency exposures ensures that portfolios remain aligned with market conditions.  \n5. **Long-Term Perspective:** Over extended periods, currency effects may average out, but short- to medium-term investors must actively manage exposure.\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n- Adler, M., & Dumas, B.

NBER Working Paper.  \n- Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Reports on Exchange Rate Developments.  \n- IMF World Economic Outlook (various years).  \n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nCurrency fluctuations significantly influence international investment returns. While exchange rate movements can amplify or erode gains, effective hedging and diversification strategies enable investors to manage this risk. A disciplined approach\u2014grounded in economic fundamentals and risk management principles\u2014remains essential for optimizing global portfolio performance.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to format this report into a **print-ready PDF layout** (with charts and tables for historical exchange rate trends)?"

Do not execute or simulate any financial transactions.\nOutput from tool_user_agent: Here\u2019s a **comprehensive analysis report** on the effects of currency fluctuations on international investments, formatted in a professional and structured manner:  \n\n---\n\n## **The Effects of Currency Fluctuations on International Investments**\n\n### **1. Theoretical Background: Exchange Rate Movements and Investment Returns**\n\n#### **1.1 Exchange Rate Fundamentals**\nExchange rates represent the value of one currency relative to another and are influenced by macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation, trade balances, and political stability. The two main exchange rate systems are:\n- **Fixed exchange rate systems**, where a currency\u2019s value is pegged to another (e.g., USD or gold).\n- **Floating exchange rate systems**, where market forces determine currency values.\n\n#### **1.2 Impact on Investment Returns**\nFor international investors, returns are affected by both **asset performance** and **currency movements**. The total return on a foreign investment can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nR_{total} = (1 + R_{foreign}) \\times (1 + R_{currency}) - 1\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( R_{foreign} \\) = return on the foreign asset in local currency.\n- \\( R_{currency} \\) = change in the exchange rate between the investor\u2019s home currency and the foreign currency.\n\nA **currency appreciation** relative to the investor\u2019s home currency enhances returns, while a **currency depreciation** reduces them.\n\n#### **1.3 Theoretical Models**\n- **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):** Suggests that exchange rates adjust to equalize the price of identical goods across countries.\n- **Interest Rate Parity (IRP):** States that differences in interest rates between two countries are offset by expected changes in exchange rates.\n- **Balance of Payments Theory:** Links exchange rate movements to trade and capital flows.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Historical Examples of Currency Fluctuations and Investment Performance**\n\n#### **2.1 USD/EUR Exchange Rate**\n- **Early 2000s:** The euro appreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar, rising from around 0.85 USD/EUR in 2001 to over 1.50 USD/EUR by 2008.  \n  - **Impact:** U.S. investors holding European equities benefited from both strong equity performance and favorable currency movements.\n- **2014\u20132016:** The euro weakened from 1.39 to 1.05 USD/EUR due to divergent monetary policies (ECB easing vs. Fed tightening).  \n  - **Impact:** U.S. investors saw reduced returns on European assets, while European investors in U.S. markets gained from a stronger dollar.\n\n#### **2.2 USD/JPY Exchange Rate**\n- **2012\u20132015:** The Japanese yen depreciated sharply from 80 to 125 per USD following aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of Japan.  \n  - **Impact:** Foreign investors in Japanese equities saw strong local returns, but U.S. investors experienced diminished gains when converted back to dollars.\n- **2020\u20132023:** The yen again weakened due to interest rate differentials, affecting global portfolios with Japanese exposure.\n\n#### **2.3 Emerging Market Currencies**\nEmerging market currencies (e.g., Brazilian real, Turkish lira) often exhibit higher volatility. Currency depreciation in these markets can erode returns even when local asset performance is strong, underscoring the importance of currency risk management.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Risk-Adjusted Returns and Hedging Strategies**\n\n#### **3.1 Risk-Adjusted Returns**\nCurrency fluctuations introduce additional volatility into international portfolios. Investors often evaluate performance using **risk-adjusted metrics** such as:\n- **Sharpe Ratio:** Measures excess return per unit of risk.\n- **Sortino Ratio:** Focuses on downside risk.\n- **Value at Risk (VaR):** Estimates potential losses due to adverse currency movements.\n\n#### **3.2 Hedging Strategies**\nTo mitigate currency risk, investors employ various hedging techniques:\n- **Forward Contracts:** Lock in future exchange rates for currency conversion.\n- **Currency Futures and Options:** Provide flexibility to manage exposure with limited upfront cost.\n- **Currency ETFs and Swaps:** Offer diversified or synthetic exposure to currency movements.\n- **Natural Hedging:** Aligning revenues and expenses in the same currency to offset risk.\n\n#### **3.3 Strategic vs. Tactical Hedging**\n- **Strategic Hedging:** Long-term policy to reduce currency exposure systematically.\n- **Tactical Hedging:** Short-term adjustments based on market outlook or macroeconomic conditions.\n\nEmpirical studies show that partial hedging (e.g., 50%) often provides an optimal balance between risk reduction and return potential.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Conclusions: Managing Currency Risk in International Portfolios**\n\n1. **Diversification:** Holding assets across multiple currencies can reduce exposure to any single currency\u2019s volatility.  \n2. **Hedging Policy:** Investors should establish a clear hedging framework aligned with their risk tolerance and investment horizon.  \n3. **Monitoring Macroeconomic Indicators:** Interest rate differentials, inflation trends, and central bank policies are key drivers of exchange rate movements.  \n4. **Dynamic Risk Management:** Regularly reassessing currency exposures ensures that portfolios remain aligned with market conditions.  \n5. **Long-Term Perspective:** Over extended periods, currency effects may average out, but short- to medium-term investors must actively manage exposure.\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n- Adler, M., & Dumas, B.

While exchange rate movements can amplify or erode gains, effective hedging and diversification strategies enable investors to manage this risk. A disciplined approach\u2014grounded in economic fundamentals and risk management principles\u2014remains essential for optimizing global portfolio performance.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to format this report into a **print-ready PDF layout** (with charts and tables for historical exchange rate trends)?\n\nTurn 2: Calling orchestrator...\nOrchestrator decision: delegate_to=tool_user_agent, done=False\nDelegating to tool_user_agent: Yes, please format the comprehensive analysis report on the effects of currency fluctuations on international investments into a print-ready PDF layout.

Conclusions: Managing Currency Risk in International Portfolios**\n\n1. **Diversify across currencies** to reduce exposure to single-currency volatility.  \n2. **Establish a clear hedging policy** aligned with investment objectives.  \n3. **Monitor macroeconomic indicators** such as interest rate differentials and inflation.  \n4. **Adopt dynamic risk management** to adjust exposures as market conditions evolve.  \n5. **Maintain a long-term perspective**\u2014currency effects may balance out over time.\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- Adler, M., & Dumas, B.

Theoretical Background: Exchange Rate Movements and Investment Returns**\n\n#### **1.1 Exchange Rate Fundamentals**\nExchange rates represent the value of one currency relative to another and are influenced by macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation, trade balances, and political stability. The two main exchange rate systems are:\n- **Fixed exchange rate systems**, where a currency\u2019s value is pegged to another (e.g., USD or gold).\n- **Floating exchange rate systems**, where market forces determine currency values.\n\n#### **1.2 Impact on Investment Returns**\nFor international investors, returns are affected by both **asset performance** and **currency movements**. The total return on a foreign investment can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nR_{total} = (1 + R_{foreign}) \\times (1 + R_{currency}) - 1\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( R_{foreign} \\) = return on the foreign asset in local currency.\n- \\( R_{currency} \\) = change in the exchange rate between the investor\u2019s home currency and the foreign currency.\n\nA **currency appreciation** relative to the investor\u2019s home currency enhances returns, while a **currency depreciation** reduces them.\n\n#### **1.3 Theoretical Models**\n- **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):** Suggests that exchange rates adjust to equalize the price of identical goods across countries.\n- **Interest Rate Parity (IRP):** States that differences in interest rates between two countries are offset by expected changes in exchange rates.\n- **Balance of Payments Theory:** Links exchange rate movements to trade and capital flows.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Historical Examples of Currency Fluctuations and Investment Performance**\n\n#### **2.1 USD/EUR Exchange Rate**\n- **Early 2000s:** The euro appreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar, rising from around 0.85 USD/EUR in 2001 to over 1.50 USD/EUR by 2008.  \n  - **Impact:** U.S. investors holding European equities benefited from both strong equity performance and favorable currency movements.\n- **2014\u20132016:** The euro weakened from 1.39 to 1.05 USD/EUR due to divergent monetary policies (ECB easing vs. Fed tightening).  \n  - **Impact:** U.S. investors saw reduced returns on European assets, while European investors in U.S. markets gained from a stronger dollar.\n\n#### **2.2 USD/JPY Exchange Rate**\n- **2012\u20132015:** The Japanese yen depreciated sharply from 80 to 125 per USD following aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of Japan.  \n  - **Impact:** Foreign investors in Japanese equities saw strong local returns, but U.S. investors experienced diminished gains when converted back to dollars.\n- **2020\u20132023:** The yen again weakened due to interest rate differentials, affecting global portfolios with Japanese exposure.\n\n#### **2.3 Emerging Market Currencies**\nEmerging market currencies (e.g., Brazilian real, Turkish lira) often exhibit higher volatility. Currency depreciation in these markets can erode returns even when local asset performance is strong, underscoring the importance of currency risk management.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Risk-Adjusted Returns and Hedging Strategies**\n\n#### **3.1 Risk-Adjusted Returns**\nCurrency fluctuations introduce additional volatility into international portfolios. Investors often evaluate performance using **risk-adjusted metrics** such as:\n- **Sharpe Ratio:** Measures excess return per unit of risk.\n- **Sortino Ratio:** Focuses on downside risk.\n- **Value at Risk (VaR):** Estimates potential losses due to adverse currency movements.\n\n#### **3.2 Hedging Strategies**\nTo mitigate currency risk, investors employ various hedging techniques:\n- **Forward Contracts:** Lock in future exchange rates for currency conversion.\n- **Currency Futures and Options:** Provide flexibility to manage exposure with limited upfront cost.\n- **Currency ETFs and Swaps:** Offer diversified or synthetic exposure to currency movements.\n- **Natural Hedging:** Aligning revenues and expenses in the same currency to offset risk.\n\n#### **3.3 Strategic vs. Tactical Hedging**\n- **Strategic Hedging:** Long-term policy to reduce currency exposure systematically.\n- **Tactical Hedging:** Short-term adjustments based on market outlook or macroeconomic conditions.\n\nEmpirical studies show that partial hedging (e.g., 50%) often provides an optimal balance between risk reduction and return potential.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Conclusions: Managing Currency Risk in International Portfolios**\n\n1. **Diversification:** Holding assets across multiple currencies can reduce exposure to any single currency\u2019s volatility.  \n2. **Hedging Policy:** Investors should establish a clear hedging framework aligned with their risk tolerance and investment horizon.  \n3. **Monitoring Macroeconomic Indicators:** Interest rate differentials, inflation trends, and central bank policies are key drivers of exchange rate movements.  \n4. **Dynamic Risk Management:** Regularly reassessing currency exposures ensures that portfolios remain aligned with market conditions.  \n5. **Long-Term Perspective:** Over extended periods, currency effects may average out, but short- to medium-term investors must actively manage exposure.\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n- Adler, M., & Dumas, B.

While exchange rate movements can amplify or erode gains, effective hedging and diversification strategies enable investors to manage this risk. A disciplined approach\u2014grounded in economic fundamentals and risk management principles\u2014remains essential for optimizing global portfolio performance.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to format this report into a **print-ready PDF layout** (with charts and tables for historical exchange rate trends)?\n\nTurn 2: Calling orchestrator...\nOrchestrator decision: delegate_to=tool_user_agent, done=False\nDelegating to tool_user_agent: Yes, please format the comprehensive analysis report on the effects of currency fluctuations on international investments into a print-ready PDF layout.

        "content": "Here\u2019s a **comprehensive analysis report** on the effects of currency fluctuations on international investments, formatted in a professional and structured manner:  \n\n---\n\n## **The Effects of Currency Fluctuations on International Investments**\n\n### **1. Theoretical Background: Exchange Rate Movements and Investment Returns**\n\n#### **1.1 Exchange Rate Fundamentals**\nExchange rates represent the value of one currency relative to another and are influenced by macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation, trade balances, and political stability. The two main exchange rate systems are:\n- **Fixed exchange rate systems**, where a currency\u2019s value is pegged to another (e.g., USD or gold).\n- **Floating exchange rate systems**, where market forces determine currency values.\n\n#### **1.2 Impact on Investment Returns**\nFor international investors, returns are affected by both **asset performance** and **currency movements**. The total return on a foreign investment can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nR_{total} = (1 + R_{foreign}) \\times (1 + R_{currency}) - 1\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( R_{foreign} \\) = return on the foreign asset in local currency.\n- \\( R_{currency} \\) = change in the exchange rate between the investor\u2019s home currency and the foreign currency.\n\nA **currency appreciation** relative to the investor\u2019s home currency enhances returns, while a **currency depreciation** reduces them.\n\n#### **1.3 Theoretical Models**\n- **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):** Suggests that exchange rates adjust to equalize the price of identical goods across countries.\n- **Interest Rate Parity (IRP):** States that differences in interest rates between two countries are offset by expected changes in exchange rates.\n- **Balance of Payments Theory:** Links exchange rate movements to trade and capital flows.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Historical Examples of Currency Fluctuations and Investment Performance**\n\n#### **2.1 USD/EUR Exchange Rate**\n- **Early 2000s:** The euro appreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar, rising from around 0.85 USD/EUR in 2001 to over 1.50 USD/EUR by 2008.  \n  - **Impact:** U.S. investors holding European equities benefited from both strong equity performance and favorable currency movements.\n- **2014\u20132016:** The euro weakened from 1.39 to 1.05 USD/EUR due to divergent monetary policies (ECB easing vs. Fed tightening).  \n  - **Impact:** U.S. investors saw reduced returns on European assets, while European investors in U.S. markets gained from a stronger dollar.\n\n#### **2.2 USD/JPY Exchange Rate**\n- **2012\u20132015:** The Japanese yen depreciated sharply from 80 to 125 per USD following aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of Japan.  \n  - **Impact:** Foreign investors in Japanese equities saw strong local returns, but U.S. investors experienced diminished gains when converted back to dollars.\n- **2020\u20132023:** The yen again weakened due to interest rate differentials, affecting global portfolios with Japanese exposure.\n\n#### **2.3 Emerging Market Currencies**\nEmerging market currencies (e.g., Brazilian real, Turkish lira) often exhibit higher volatility. Currency depreciation in these markets can erode returns even when local asset performance is strong, underscoring the importance of currency risk management.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Risk-Adjusted Returns and Hedging Strategies**\n\n#### **3.1 Risk-Adjusted Returns**\nCurrency fluctuations introduce additional volatility into international portfolios. Investors often evaluate performance using **risk-adjusted metrics** such as:\n- **Sharpe Ratio:** Measures excess return per unit of risk.\n- **Sortino Ratio:** Focuses on downside risk.\n- **Value at Risk (VaR):** Estimates potential losses due to adverse currency movements.\n\n#### **3.2 Hedging Strategies**\nTo mitigate currency risk, investors employ various hedging techniques:\n- **Forward Contracts:** Lock in future exchange rates for currency conversion.\n- **Currency Futures and Options:** Provide flexibility to manage exposure with limited upfront cost.\n- **Currency ETFs and Swaps:** Offer diversified or synthetic exposure to currency movements.\n- **Natural Hedging:** Aligning revenues and expenses in the same currency to offset risk.\n\n#### **3.3 Strategic vs. Tactical Hedging**\n- **Strategic Hedging:** Long-term policy to reduce currency exposure systematically.\n- **Tactical Hedging:** Short-term adjustments based on market outlook or macroeconomic conditions.\n\nEmpirical studies show that partial hedging (e.g., 50%) often provides an optimal balance between risk reduction and return potential.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Conclusions: Managing Currency Risk in International Portfolios**\n\n1. **Diversification:** Holding assets across multiple currencies can reduce exposure to any single currency\u2019s volatility.  \n2. **Hedging Policy:** Investors should establish a clear hedging framework aligned with their risk tolerance and investment horizon.  \n3. **Monitoring Macroeconomic Indicators:** Interest rate differentials, inflation trends, and central bank policies are key drivers of exchange rate movements.  \n4. **Dynamic Risk Management:** Regularly reassessing currency exposures ensures that portfolios remain aligned with market conditions.  \n5. **Long-Term Perspective:** Over extended periods, currency effects may average out, but short- to medium-term investors must actively manage exposure.\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n- Adler, M., & Dumas, B.

While exchange rate movements can amplify or erode gains, effective hedging and diversification strategies enable investors to manage this risk. A disciplined approach\u2014grounded in economic fundamentals and risk management principles\u2014remains essential for optimizing global portfolio performance.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to format this report into a **print-ready PDF layout** (with charts and tables for historical exchange rate trends)?"

Common performance metrics include:\n- **Sharpe Ratio:** Measures excess return per unit of total risk.\n- **Sortino Ratio:** Focuses on downside volatility.\n- **Value at Risk (VaR):** Quantifies potential losses from adverse currency moves.\n\n**Table 4: Example of Risk-Adjusted Returns (Unhedged vs. Hedged Portfolio)**\n\n| Portfolio Type | Annual Return | Volatility | Sharpe Ratio |\n|-----------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Unhedged | 8.2% | 14.5% | 0.45 |\n| 50% Hedged | 7.8% | 10.2% | 0.58 |\n| Fully Hedged | 7.5% | 8.0% | 0.62 |\n\n### **3.2 Hedging Strategies**\n| Strategy | Description | Advantages | Limitations |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Forward Contracts | Lock in future exchange rates | Simple, predictable | No upside participation |\n| Currency Futures/Options | Flexible exposure management | Liquidity, leverage | Requires active management |\n| Currency ETFs | Diversified exposure | Easy to trade | Tracking error risk |\n| Natural Hedging | Match revenues and costs in same currency | Cost-effective | Limited flexibility |\n\n### **3.3 Strategic vs. Tactical Hedging**\n- **Strategic Hedging:** Long-term policy to systematically reduce exposure.  \n- **Tactical Hedging:** Short-term adjustments based on market outlook.  \n\nEmpirical evidence suggests **partial hedging (40\u201360%)** often optimizes the trade-off between risk and return.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Conclusions: Managing Currency Risk in International Portfolios**\n\n1. **Diversify across currencies** to reduce exposure to single-currency volatility.  \n2. **Establish a clear hedging policy** aligned with investment objectives.  \n3. **Monitor macroeconomic indicators** such as interest rate differentials and inflation.  \n4. **Adopt dynamic risk management** to adjust exposures as market conditions evolve.  \n5. **Maintain a long-term perspective**\u2014currency effects may balance out over time.\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- Adler, M., & Dumas, B.
