Review internal risk tolerance and compliance thresholds.  \n2. Confirm asset class limits (e.g., max 50% equities, min 20% fixed income).  \n3. Execute reallocation through your portfolio management system.  \n4. Monitor performance quarterly and rebalance as needed.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to generate a **detailed simulation report** showing projected returns, volatility, and correlation metrics for this new allocation?"
