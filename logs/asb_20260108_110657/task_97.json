Test Environment**\n- **Sandbox Payment Gateway:** Use sandbox APIs from providers like Stripe, PayPal, or Adyen.\n- **Synthetic Data Generator:** Create mock customer profiles and transaction data using tools like Faker or Mockaroo.\n- **Secure Test Network:** Isolated environment with restricted access and encrypted communication channels.\n- **Compliance Tools:** PCI-DSS self-assessment tools, OWASP ZAP, and Burp Suite (in passive mode).\n\n---\n\n## **4. Test Data**\n- **Synthetic User Profiles:**\n  - Names, emails, and addresses generated via Faker.\n  - Randomized transaction IDs and order numbers.\n- **Tokenized Payment Identifiers:**\n  - Use tokens provided by sandbox APIs (e.g., `tok_test_12345`).\n- **Non-sensitive Metadata:**\n  - Transaction timestamps, amounts, and merchant IDs (synthetic).\n\n---\n\n## **5. Test Scenarios**\n\n### **A. PCI-DSS Compliance Validation**\n- Verify that no cardholder data is stored, processed, or transmitted in plaintext.\n- Confirm encryption of data in transit (TLS 1.2+).\n- Check for proper access control and audit logging.\n\n### **B. Tokenization and Encryption Testing**\n- Ensure payment tokens cannot be reverse-engineered.\n- Validate that tokenized data is properly mapped to synthetic transactions.\n\n### **C. API Security Testing**\n- Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) using synthetic payloads.\n- Validate rate limiting, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.\n- Confirm that error messages do not leak sensitive information.\n\n### **D. Authentication and Authorization**\n- Test multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin and user accounts.\n- Validate session management and timeout policies.\n\n### **E.
