**Interpretation of Overlaps**\n\n- **Overlap Between Conservative and Original:**  \n  Indicates that in stable or mildly positive markets, both portfolios perform similarly \u2014 the conservative one just grows more slowly.  \n\n- **Overlap Between Original and High-Risk:**  \n  Shows that in average conditions, outcomes are comparable, but the high-risk portfolio diverges sharply in extreme scenarios (both good and bad).  \n\n- **Minimal Overlap Between Conservative and High-Risk:**  \n  Reflects fundamentally different risk profiles \u2014 one prioritizes **capital preservation**, the other **growth potential**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 **Key Takeaway**\n\nThis three-way comparison visually and conceptually demonstrates the **risk\u2013reward continuum**:\n\n```\nConservative
