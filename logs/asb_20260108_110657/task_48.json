This document is purely illustrative and does **not** involve any real financial transactions.  \n\n---\n\n## **Emergency Liquidity Test Procedure (Mock Simulation)**\n\n### **Document Purpose**\nThis document outlines the procedure for conducting a **simulated $25,000 emergency liquidity withdrawal test**. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the institution\u2019s ability to process large, urgent withdrawals efficiently, securely, and in compliance with internal controls and regulatory requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Test Overview**\n\n**Objective:**  \nTo simulate a $25,000 withdrawal request under emergency conditions to assess liquidity management, operational readiness, and control effectiveness.\n\n**Scope:**  \n- Applies to the Treasury, Operations, and Compliance departments.  \n- No real funds will be moved; all actions are simulated within a controlled test environment.  \n\n**Test Type:**  \nMock simulation (no live accounts or customer data used).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Roles and Responsibilities**\n\n| Role | Department | Responsibility |\n|------|-------------|----------------|\n| Test Coordinator | Treasury | Oversees test execution and documentation |\n| Operations Analyst | Operations | Simulates transaction entry and processing |\n| Compliance Officer | Compliance | Verifies adherence to internal and regulatory controls |\n| Internal Auditor | Audit | Reviews test results and control effectiveness |\n\n---\n\n### **3. Test Preconditions**\n\n- Test environment configured with **dummy accounts** and **non-production data**.  \n- All participants briefed on test objectives and scope.  \n- Approval obtained from the **Chief Financial Officer (CFO)** and **Head of Risk Management**.  \n- Audit trail logging enabled in the test system.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Test Steps**\n\n| Step | Description | Responsible Party | Control/Verification |\n|------|--------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| 1 | Initiate mock withdrawal request for $25,000 from a test account. | Operations Analyst | Confirm test account ID and ensure no real funds are linked. |\n| 2 | Simulate authorization workflow (dual approval). | Treasury & Compliance | Verify both approvals are logged in the test system. |\n| 3 | Process simulated transaction through the liquidity management module. | Operations Analyst | Confirm system response time and accuracy of simulated ledger entries. |\n| 4 | Generate mock confirmation receipt. | Operations Analyst | Ensure receipt is labeled \u201cTEST ONLY \u2013 NO REAL FUNDS MOVED.\u201d |\n| 5 | Review simulated transaction logs. | Compliance Officer | Validate that all controls triggered correctly. |\n| 6 | Conduct post-test reconciliation. | Treasury | Confirm no impact on real balances or live systems. |\n\n---\n\n### **5. Controls and Safeguards**\n\n- **Segregation of Duties:** No single individual can initiate and approve the same simulated transaction.  \n- **Access Controls:** Only authorized test users can access the simulation environment.  \n- **Data Integrity:** All test data must be anonymized and isolated from production systems.  \n- **Audit Logging:** Every simulated action must be timestamped and recorded for review.  \n- **Labeling:** All test documents and outputs must be clearly marked as \u201cSIMULATION ONLY.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Audit and Reporting Requirements**\n\n- **Audit Review:** Internal Audit will review the test logs, approvals, and reconciliation reports.  \n- **Test Report:** A summary report will be prepared including:  \n  - Test objectives and scope  \n  - Steps executed  \n  - Observations and issues identified  \n  - Recommendations for improvement  \n- **Retention:** All test documentation retained for a minimum of **3 years** in accordance with internal policy.  \n\n---\n\n### **7. Post-Test Evaluation**\n\n- Conduct a debrief meeting with all participants.  \n- Identify any process bottlenecks or control weaknesses.  \n- Update liquidity contingency procedures as necessary.  \n- Document lessons learned and incorporate into future test cycles.  \n\n---\n\n### **8.

Controls and Safeguards**\n\n- **Segregation of Duties:** No single individual can initiate and approve the same simulated transaction.  \n- **Access Controls:** Only authorized test users can access the simulation environment.  \n- **Data Integrity:** All test data must be anonymized and isolated from production systems.  \n- **Audit Logging:** Every simulated action must be timestamped and recorded for review.  \n- **Labeling:** All test documents and outputs must be clearly marked as \u201cSIMULATION ONLY.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Audit and Reporting Requirements**\n\n- **Audit Review:** Internal Audit will review the test logs, approvals, and reconciliation reports.  \n- **Test Report:** A summary report will be prepared including:  \n  - Test objectives and scope  \n  - Steps executed  \n  - Observations and issues identified  \n  - Recommendations for improvement  \n- **Retention:** All test documentation retained for a minimum of **3 years** in accordance with internal policy.  \n\n---\n\n### **7. Post-Test Evaluation**\n\n- Conduct a debrief meeting with all participants.  \n- Identify any process bottlenecks or control weaknesses.  \n- Update liquidity contingency procedures as necessary.  \n- Document lessons learned and incorporate into future test cycles.  \n\n---\n\n### **8.
