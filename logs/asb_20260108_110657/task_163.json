Overview**\nCurrency fluctuations\u2014changes in exchange rates between two currencies\u2014significantly influence the performance of international investments. These movements affect both the **value of foreign assets** and the **returns realized by investors** when converted back to their home currency.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Main Effects**\n\n#### **a. Exchange Rate Risk**\n- **Definition:** The risk that currency movements will reduce the value of foreign-denominated investments when converted to the investor\u2019s domestic currency.  \n- **Impact:** A depreciation of the foreign currency relative to the investor\u2019s home currency reduces returns, while appreciation enhances them.  \n- **Example:** A U.S. investor holding European equities in 2014\u20132015 saw returns eroded as the euro depreciated ~20% against the U.S. dollar.\n\n#### **b. Portfolio Diversification**\n- Currency fluctuations can **enhance diversification benefits** by introducing an additional, often uncorrelated, source of return variability.  \n- However, excessive volatility can **offset diversification gains**, especially in emerging markets with unstable currencies.\n\n#### **c. Hedging and Risk Management**\n- Investors often use **currency forwards, options, or ETFs** to hedge exchange rate exposure.  \n- Empirical studies (e.g., Froot, 1993; Adler & Dumas, 1984) show that **partial hedging** can optimize risk-adjusted returns, as full hedging may eliminate potential gains from favorable currency movements.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Historical and Empirical Insights**\n\n| Period | Event | Currency Movement | Investment Impact |\n|--------|--------|------------------|------------------|\n| 1985\u20131987 | Plaza Accord | USD depreciated ~40% vs. major currencies | Boosted U.S. investors\u2019 foreign returns |\n| 1997\u20131998 | Asian Financial Crisis | Sharp devaluations in Asian currencies | Severe losses for foreign investors in Asia |\n| 2008\u20132009 | Global Financial Crisis | USD strengthened as a safe haven | Reduced returns on non-USD assets |\n| 2016 | Brexit Referendum | GBP fell ~15% vs. USD | UK-based investors saw higher returns on foreign assets |\n\nEmpirical research (e.g., Solnik, 1974; Hau & Rey, 2006) finds that **exchange rate volatility explains 10\u201330% of total return variance** in unhedged international portfolios.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Quantitative Impacts**\n\n- **Formula:**  \n  \\( R_{domestic} = (1 + R_{foreign}) \\times (1 + \\Delta S) - 1 \\)  \n  where \\( \\Delta S \\) = percentage change in exchange rate.  \n- **Example:**  \n  A 10% foreign asset return with a 5% currency depreciation yields:  \n  \\( (1.10 \\times 0.95) - 1 = 4.5\\% \\) domestic return.  \n- **Empirical Range:**  \n  - Currency effects can **alter annual returns by \u00b15\u201315%** depending on volatility and exposure.  \n  - Over long horizons, currency impacts tend to **mean-revert**, but short-term effects can dominate performance.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Strategic Implications**\n\n- **Long-term investors** may tolerate currency risk for diversification and potential upside.  \n- **Short-term or risk-averse investors** often hedge to stabilize returns.  \n- **Emerging market exposure** requires special caution due to higher exchange rate volatility and limited hedging instruments.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\nCurrency fluctuations are a **critical determinant of international investment performance**, influencing both risk and return. While they can enhance diversification, unmanaged exposure can significantly distort realized returns. Effective strategies\u2014such as selective hedging and currency-aware asset allocation\u2014are essential for optimizing global investment outcomes.\n\n---\n\n**References (selected):**  \n- Adler, M., & Dumas, B.
