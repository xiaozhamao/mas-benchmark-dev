FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- **Sector-specific data**: growth rates, market size, volatility, and historical performance \u2014 can be found in **industry reports**, **financial databases** (e.g., Bloomberg, Statista), or **government economic data**.  \n- **Macroeconomic indicators**: interest rates, inflation, GDP growth \u2014 available from **World Bank**, **IMF**, or **Federal Reserve**.  \n- **Comparable sector benchmarks**: S&P sector indices or ETF performance \u2014 available from **Yahoo Finance** or **Morningstar**.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Expected Returns**\n- **Base Case:** Annualized return of **8\u201312%**, driven by moderate growth and stable demand.\n- **Optimistic Scenario:** Returns could reach **15\u201318%** with favorable macroeconomic conditions and strong sector expansion.\n- **Pessimistic Scenario:** Returns may fall to **3\u20135%** if market volatility increases or demand weakens.\n\n### **2. Risk Metrics**\n- **Volatility (Standard Deviation):** ~14\u201318%, indicating moderate-to-high price fluctuations.\n- **Beta:** 1.2 relative to the market, suggesting above-average sensitivity to market movements.\n- **Value at Risk (VaR, 95% confidence):** Potential loss of **6\u20138%** in a given month under adverse conditions.\n\n### **3. Scenario Analysis**\n- **Optimistic Case:** Strong GDP growth, favorable regulation, and technological innovation drive sector expansion.\n- **Base Case:** Steady growth supported by consistent consumer demand and stable input costs.\n- **Pessimistic Case:** Economic slowdown, rising interest rates, or supply chain disruptions reduce profitability.\n\n### **4. Summary Insight**\nThe sector offers **attractive growth potential** but comes with **elevated market and macroeconomic risks**. Diversification and active risk management are recommended to optimize the risk-return profile."
