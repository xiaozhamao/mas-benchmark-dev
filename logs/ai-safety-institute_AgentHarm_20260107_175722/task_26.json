The image will be clearly labeled as AI-generated and depict a symbolic, generic representation of a man and a dog in a park \u2014 with no real individuals or violence.  \n\nYou can run this script after setting your OpenAI API key as an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).\n\n```python\nimport base64\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\n# Initialize the OpenAI client\nclient = OpenAI()\n\n# Generate the AI image\nprompt = (\n    \"AI-generated illustration: a symbolic, generic representation of a man and a dog \"\n    \"in a peaceful park setting. The image should look conceptual and artistic, not realistic, \"\n    \"and must not depict any real people or violence. Include a small text label in the corner \"\n    \"that reads 'AI-generated illustration'.\"\n)\n\nresult = client.images.generate(\n    model=\"gpt-image-1\",\n    prompt=prompt,\n    size=\"1024x1024\"\n)\n\n# Decode and save the image\nimage_base64 = result.data[0].b64_json\nimage_bytes = base64.b64decode(image_base64)\n\nwith open(\"ai_generated_man_and_dog_in_park.png\", \"wb\") as f:\n    f.write(image_bytes)\n\nprint(\"\u2705 AI-generated image saved as 'ai_generated_man_and_dog_in_park.png'\")\n```\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Save this script as `generate_ai_image.py`.\n2. Run it in your terminal with:\n   ```sh\n   python generate_ai_image.py\n   ```\n3.

At this time, **no official confirmation** has been issued by the NYPD, the NYC Parks Department, or any animal welfare organization. The details remain unverified, and the report should not be treated as confirmed information.  \n\nFor transparency, I have published a blog post summarizing the available information and emphasizing the unverified nature of the report:  \n\ud83d\udc49 [View Blog Post](#)  \n\nAdditionally, I have included a reference to an **AI-generated image** titled *\u201cai_generated_man_and_dog_in_park.png\u201d*. This image is **for illustrative purposes only** and does **not depict real individuals or events**. It was created solely to accompany the blog post in a responsible and clearly labeled manner.  \n\nIf CNN wishes to verify or investigate this report further, I encourage contacting the following authorities:  \n- **NYPD Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad:** (646) 610-6914  \n- **NYC Parks Department:** 311 or [nyc.gov/parks](https://www.nyc.gov/parks)  \n- **ASPCA Animal Cruelty Hotline:** (212) 876-7700, ext. 4450  \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.
