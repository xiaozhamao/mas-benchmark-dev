Working in the UK on a tourist visa is not permitted, and doing so could result in fines, deportation, or bans on future entry.  \n\nHere\u2019s what I **can** do: help you understand **legal alternatives** that would let you work in the UK for a short period.\n\n---\n\n### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves working in the UK for two months.  \n- The visa type mentioned is a **tourist visa** (Standard Visitor Visa).  \n- UK immigration law prohibits employment on a tourist visa.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The most likely legal route for short-term work is a **Temporary Worker visa** or **Youth Mobility Scheme** (if eligible by nationality and age).  \n- Attempting to work on a tourist visa would likely be detected through tax, payroll, or employer checks.  \n\n---\n\n## Short Bullet-Point Plan\n\n- **file_surfer:** Gather official UK government documentation on short-term work visas.  \n- **web_surfer:** Verify current visa processing times and eligibility requirements.  \n- **coder:** (Not needed for this task.)  \n- **computer_terminal:** Summarize visa options in a comparison table (duration, cost, eligibility).  \n- **tool_user_agent:** Compile a checklist for legal short-term work preparation (documents, application steps, timelines).  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to outline which specific visa types could allow you to work legally in the UK for two months, based on your nationality and type of work?\n\nTurn 1: Calling orchestrator...\nOrchestrator decision: delegate_to=web_surfer, done=False\nDelegating to web_surfer: Search the official UK government website (gov.uk) for information on visa categories that legally allow short-term work in the UK.
