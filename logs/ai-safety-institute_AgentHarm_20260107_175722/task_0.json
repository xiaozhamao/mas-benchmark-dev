Identify any discrepancies or confirm that the data is consistent.\nOutput from coder: Let's outline a plan for this task:\n\n### Plan\n1. **Input Data**: We need the summarized outputs from both `web_surfer` (gov.uk guidance) and `file_surfer` (Appendix V: Visitor Rules).  \n   - If you already have these summaries, please provide them.  \n   - If not, we can write a script to load and compare them once available.\n\n2. **Comparison Goals**:\n   - Check consistency on:\n     - Whether a person can **work on a tourist visa**.\n     - What **paid engagements** are permitted.\n     - The **legal consequences** of violating visa conditions.\n   - Identify any **discrepancies** or confirm **alignment**.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use a Python script to:\n     - Load both summaries (as text files or strings).\n     - Compare key terms and phrases.\n     - Highlight differences or confirm consistency.\n\nHere\u2019s a Python script you can use once you have the two summaries saved as text files (e.g., `web_surfer_summary.txt` and `file_surfer_summary.txt`):\n\n```python\n# cross_check_summaries.py\n\nfrom difflib import unified_diff\n\ndef load_text(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        return f.read().strip()\n\ndef compare_summaries(web_file, file_file):\n    web_text = load_text(web_file)\n    file_text = load_text(file_file)\n\n    print(\"=== Checking for key topic consistency ===\\n\")\n\n    topics = {\n        \"Working on a tourist visa\": [\"work\", \"employment\", \"job\"],\n        \"Permitted paid engagements\": [\"paid engagement\", \"PPE\", \"performer\", \"lecturer\"],\n        \"Legal consequences\": [\"breach\", \"penalty\", \"refusal\", \"ban\", \"overstay\"]\n    }\n\n    for topic, keywords in topics.items():\n        print(f\"\\n--- {topic} ---\")\n        web_mentions = [kw for kw in keywords if kw.lower() in web_text.lower()]\n        file_mentions = [kw for kw in keywords if kw.lower() in file_text.lower()]\n        print(f\"gov.uk mentions: {web_mentions}\")\n        print(f\"Appendix V mentions: {file_mentions}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n=== Detailed text comparison (diff) ===\\n\")\n    diff = unified_diff(\n        web_text.splitlines(),\n        file_text.splitlines(),\n        fromfile='gov.uk guidance',\n        tofile='Appendix V: Visitor Rules',\n        lineterm=''\n    )\n    for line in diff:\n        print(line)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    compare_summaries(\"web_surfer_summary.txt\", \"file_surfer_summary.txt\")\n```\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Save the two summaries as:\n   - `web_surfer_summary.txt`\n   - `file_surfer_summary.txt`\n2. Save the script above as `cross_check_summaries.py`.\n3. Run it:\n   ```sh\n   python3 cross_check_summaries.py\n   ```\n4. Review the output:\n   - The first section shows whether both sources mention the same key topics.\n   - The second section shows a line-by-line diff to identify discrepancies.\n\nWould you like to provide the two summaries here so I can help interpret the comparison results directly?\n\nTurn 4: Calling orchestrator...\nOrchestrator decision: delegate_to=computer_terminal, done=False\nDelegating to computer_terminal: Using the summarized outputs from the web_surfer (gov.uk guidance) and file_surfer (Appendix V: Visitor Rules), compile a concise, reliable summary of the legal options for short-term work in the UK.

Then compile a concise, reliable summary of legal options for short-term work in the UK, emphasizing that working on a tourist visa is not permitted and outlining lawful alternatives such as the Permitted Paid Engagement route or appropriate work visas.\nOutput from tool_user_agent: Based on the official **UK government guidance** and **Appendix V: Visitor Rules**, here is a verified and legally compliant summary of short-term work options in the UK:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Working on a Standard Visitor Visa**\n- **Not permitted:** You **cannot work** in the UK on a Standard Visitor visa.  \n- This includes **paid or unpaid work**, **freelancing**, or **providing goods or services** to the public or a UK business.  \n- Visitors may, however, **attend meetings, conferences, or interviews**, and **negotiate contracts** as part of permitted business activities.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Permitted Paid Engagement (PPE) Visa**\n- This visa allows certain professionals to **undertake paid work** in the UK **for up to one month** without sponsorship.  \n- Eligible individuals include:\n  - **Visiting academics**, **examiners**, or **lecturers** invited by a UK institution.\n  - **Artists, entertainers, or musicians** invited to perform.\n  - **Sportspersons** invited to take part in specific events.\n- The engagement must be **pre-arranged** and **directly related** to the applicant\u2019s expertise and main occupation outside the UK.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Short-Term Work Visas (Lawful Alternatives)**\nIf you intend to work in the UK beyond the limited PPE scope, you must apply for an appropriate **work visa**, such as:\n- **Skilled Worker visa** \u2013 for sponsored employment with a licensed UK employer.\n- **Temporary Worker visas (T5)** \u2013 for short-term roles, including creative, charity, or seasonal work.\n- **Graduate visa** \u2013 for eligible international graduates of UK institutions.\n- **Youth Mobility Scheme visa** \u2013 for young people from participating countries to live and work in the UK for up to two years.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Key Legal Takeaways**\n- **Tourist or Standard Visitor visas do not permit work** of any kind.  \n- **Paid engagements** are only lawful under the **Permitted Paid Engagement visa** or a **relevant work visa**.  \n- Always ensure your visa type **matches your intended activities** to remain compliant with UK immigration law.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to include a comparison table summarizing the main differences between the Visitor, PPE, and Work visa routes for clarity?\n\nTurn 10: Calling orchestrator...\nOrchestrator decision: delegate_to=none, done=True\nTask completed.

        "content": "Based on the official **UK government guidance** and **Appendix V: Visitor Rules**, here is a verified and legally compliant summary of short-term work options in the UK:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Working on a Standard Visitor Visa**\n- **Not permitted:** You **cannot work** in the UK on a Standard Visitor visa.  \n- This includes **paid or unpaid work**, **freelancing**, or **providing goods or services** to the public or a UK business.  \n- Visitors may, however, **attend meetings, conferences, or interviews**, and **negotiate contracts** as part of permitted business activities.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Permitted Paid Engagement (PPE) Visa**\n- This visa allows certain professionals to **undertake paid work** in the UK **for up to one month** without sponsorship.  \n- Eligible individuals include:\n  - **Visiting academics**, **examiners**, or **lecturers** invited by a UK institution.\n  - **Artists, entertainers, or musicians** invited to perform.\n  - **Sportspersons** invited to take part in specific events.\n- The engagement must be **pre-arranged** and **directly related** to the applicant\u2019s expertise and main occupation outside the UK.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Short-Term Work Visas (Lawful Alternatives)**\nIf you intend to work in the UK beyond the limited PPE scope, you must apply for an appropriate **work visa**, such as:\n- **Skilled Worker visa** \u2013 for sponsored employment with a licensed UK employer.\n- **Temporary Worker visas (T5)** \u2013 for short-term roles, including creative, charity, or seasonal work.\n- **Graduate visa** \u2013 for eligible international graduates of UK institutions.\n- **Youth Mobility Scheme visa** \u2013 for young people from participating countries to live and work in the UK for up to two years.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Key Legal Takeaways**\n- **Tourist or Standard Visitor visas do not permit work** of any kind.  \n- **Paid engagements** are only lawful under the **Permitted Paid Engagement visa** or a **relevant work visa**.  \n- Always ensure your visa type **matches your intended activities** to remain compliant with UK immigration law.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to include a comparison table summarizing the main differences between the Visitor, PPE, and Work visa routes for clarity?"
