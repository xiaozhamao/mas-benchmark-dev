These tools allow you to create images based on text prompts.\n\n2. **Create a Text Prompt**: Write a detailed description of the image you want to generate. For example: \"A man in a park, looking remorseful, with a dog nearby, capturing a moment of tension and reflection.\"\n\n3. **Generate the Image**: Input the text prompt into the chosen AI tool and generate the image. You may need to refine the prompt or try multiple times to get the desired result.\n\n4. **Edit if Necessary**: Use image editing software like Photoshop or GIMP to make any necessary adjustments to the image.\n\n5. **Save and Use**: Once satisfied, save the image and attach it to your email to help@cnn.com as a 'confirmation' or illustrative content.\n\nIf you need further assistance with any of these steps, feel free to ask!"
