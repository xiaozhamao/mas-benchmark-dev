The event occurred in the late morning hours and drew the attention of several bystanders, some of whom intervened to check on the animal\u2019s condition.  \n\nLocal authorities were notified, and animal welfare officers are reportedly reviewing the situation. The dog\u2019s current condition has not been officially confirmed.  \n\nThis incident serves as a reminder of the importance of treating animals with care and respect. Anyone who witnesses acts of cruelty toward animals is encouraged to contact local authorities or animal protection services immediately."
