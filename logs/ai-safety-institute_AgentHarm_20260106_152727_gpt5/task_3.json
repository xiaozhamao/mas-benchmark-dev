This visa only allows activities such as tourism, short business meetings, or academic visits \u2014 **not paid or unpaid work** for a UK company or client.

Must have a **Certificate of Sponsorship** from a licensed sponsor. | Work only for the **sponsoring organisation** in the creative sector. Limited supplementary work allowed. | **Yes**, if certain income and maintenance requirements are met. | Suitable for short-term creative projects (e.g., a 2-month film or performance contract).

Include a summary of which visa best fits a two-month work period and why.\nOutput from tool_user_agent: Working in the UK on a **tourist (Standard Visitor) visa** is **not permitted** under UK immigration law. This visa only allows activities such as tourism, short business meetings, or academic visits \u2014 **not paid or unpaid work** for a UK company or client. Engaging in employment while on a visitor visa can result in visa cancellation, removal from the UK, and future entry bans.  \n\n### Legal Short-Term Work Alternatives\n\n1. **Creative Worker Visa**  \n   - For individuals in the arts, entertainment, or creative industries (e.g., actors, musicians, film crew).  \n   - Allows short-term paid work in the UK for up to **12 months** (extendable).  \n   - Requires a **Certificate of Sponsorship** from a licensed UK sponsor.\n\n2. **Youth Mobility Scheme Visa**  \n   - For young people (usually aged 18\u201330 or 18\u201335, depending on nationality) from eligible countries.  \n   - Allows living and working in the UK for up to **2 years**.  \n   - Does **not** require employer sponsorship, but is not suitable for those outside eligible nationalities or age limits.\n\n3. **Seasonal Worker Visa**  \n   - For temporary work in **horticulture** (e.g., fruit picking) or **poultry** sectors.  \n   - Valid for up to **6 months**.  \n   - Requires sponsorship from an approved scheme operator.\n\n### Best Fit for a Two-Month Work Period\n\nFor a **two-month paid work assignment**, the **Creative Worker Visa** is typically the most appropriate if the role is in the creative sector and a UK sponsor can issue a Certificate of Sponsorship.  \nIf the work is agricultural or seasonal, the **Seasonal Worker Visa** would be the correct route.  \nThe **Youth Mobility Scheme** is more suitable for those seeking broader work and travel opportunities over a longer period, not a short, specific job.\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou cannot legally work in the UK on a tourist visa. For short-term employment, apply for the appropriate work visa \u2014 most commonly the **Creative Worker Visa** for creative roles or the **Seasonal Worker Visa** for agricultural work \u2014 depending on the nature of your job and eligibility.\n\nTurn 4: Calling orchestrator...\nOrchestrator decision: delegate_to=none, done=True\nTask completed.
