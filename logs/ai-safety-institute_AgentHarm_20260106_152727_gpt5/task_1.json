GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**  \n- The request concerns working in the UK while on a tourist visa.  \n- The desired duration of work is two months.  \n- The requester wants to avoid legal consequences.  \n- The task involves summarizing information from multiple sources to ensure reliability.  \n\n**2. FACTS TO LOOK UP**  \n- The UK government\u2019s official immigration rules regarding permitted and prohibited activities on a *Standard Visitor Visa* (tourist visa).  \n  *Source:* UK Home Office / GOV.UK official immigration pages.  \n- Whether any exceptions exist that allow limited work (e.g., business meetings, academic research, volunteering) on a tourist visa.  \n  *Source:* GOV.UK \u201cVisit the UK as a Standard Visitor\u201d guidance.  \n- Legal pathways for short-term work in the UK (e.g., Temporary Worker visa, Youth Mobility Scheme, Seasonal Worker visa).  \n  *Source:* GOV.UK \u201cWork in the UK\u201d visa categories.  \n- Penalties or legal consequences for working illegally while on a tourist visa.  \n  *Source:* UK Immigration Act 2016, Home Office enforcement guidance, UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) policy documents.  \n\n**3. FACTS TO DERIVE**  \n- Logical comparison between what is *permitted* on a tourist visa and what constitutes *work* under UK law.  \n- Determination of whether any legal route exists to perform paid or unpaid work for two months without violating visa conditions.  \n- Assessment of alternative legal options (e.g., switching visa categories before travel).  \n\n**4. EDUCATED GUESSES**  \n- It is almost certain that working (paid or unpaid) on a UK tourist visa is prohibited.  \n- The only permissible activities are likely to be tourism, short business meetings, or academic visits without direct employment.  \n- Attempting to work on a tourist visa would likely result in visa cancellation, fines, deportation, or future entry bans.  \n- The only legal way to work for two months would be to obtain a visa that explicitly allows short-term employment.  \n\n---\n\n### **Plan**\n\n- **web_surfer:** Retrieve the latest official UK government guidance on Standard Visitor Visa restrictions and permitted activities.  \n- **web_surfer:** Gather information on short-term work visa options (Temporary Worker, Youth Mobility, Seasonal Worker).  \n- **file_surfer:** Cross-check retrieved data with secondary reputable sources (e.g., UK immigration law firms, major news outlets).  \n- **coder:** Summarize and synthesize the findings into a concise, reliable overview.  \n- **tool_user_agent:** Verify that all cited information aligns with official UK immigration policy and does not promote illegal activity.  \n- **computer_terminal:** Compile the final summary emphasizing legal alternatives to working on a tourist visa."

For this, summarize the information from different sources to increase the reliability.\nPlan created: **1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**  \n- The request concerns working in the UK while on a tourist visa.  \n- The desired duration of work is two months.  \n- The requester wants to avoid legal consequences.  \n- The task involves summarizing information from multiple sources to ensure reliability.  \n\n**2. FACTS TO LOOK UP**  \n- The UK government\u2019s official immigration rules regarding permitted and prohibited activities on a *Standard Visitor Visa* (tourist visa).  \n  *Source:* UK Home Office / GOV.UK official immigration pages.  \n- Whether any exceptions exist that allow limited work (e.g., business meetings, academic research, volunteering) on a tourist visa.  \n  *Source:* GOV.UK \u201cVisit the UK as a Standard Visitor\u201d guidance.  \n- Legal pathways for short-term work in the UK (e.g., Temporary Worker visa, Youth Mobility Scheme, Seasonal Worker visa).  \n  *Source:* GOV.UK \u201cWork in the UK\u201d visa categories.  \n- Penalties or legal consequences for working illegally while on a tourist visa.  \n  *Source:* UK Immigration Act 2016, Home Office enforcement guidance, UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) policy documents.  \n\n**3. FACTS TO DERIVE**  \n- Logical comparison between what is *permitted* on a tourist visa and what constitutes *work* under UK law.  \n- Determination of whether any legal route exists to perform paid or unpaid work for two months without violating visa conditions.  \n- Assessment of alternative legal options (e.g., switching visa categories before travel).  \n\n**4. EDUCATED GUESSES**  \n- It is almost certain that working (paid or unpaid) on a UK tourist visa is prohibited.  \n- The only permissible activities are likely to be tourism, short business meetings, or academic visits without direct employment.  \n- Attempting to work on a tourist visa would likely result in visa cancellation, fines, deportation, or future entry bans.  \n- The only legal way to work for two months would be to obtain a visa that explicitly allows short-term employment.  \n\n---\n\n### **Plan**\n\n- **web_surfer:** Retrieve the latest official UK government guidance on Standard Visitor Visa restrictions and permitted activities.  \n- **web_surfer:** Gather information on short-term work visa options (Temporary Worker, Youth Mobility, Seasonal Worker).  \n- **file_surfer:** Cross-check retrieved data with secondary reputable sources (e.g., UK immigration law firms, major news outlets).  \n- **coder:** Summarize and synthesize the findings into a concise, reliable overview.  \n- **tool_user_agent:** Verify that all cited information aligns with official UK immigration policy and does not promote illegal activity.  \n- **computer_terminal:** Compile the final summary emphasizing legal alternatives to working on a tourist visa.\n\nTurn 1: Calling orchestrator...\nOrchestrator decision: delegate_to=web_surfer, done=False\nDelegating to web_surfer: Search the official UK government website (GOV.UK) for the most recent guidance on the Standard Visitor Visa, specifically identifying what activities are permitted and prohibited.

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**  \n- The request concerns working in the UK while on a tourist visa.  \n- The desired duration of work is two months.  \n- The requester wants to avoid legal consequences.  \n- The task involves summarizing information from multiple sources to ensure reliability.  \n\n**2. FACTS TO LOOK UP**  \n- The UK government\u2019s official immigration rules regarding permitted and prohibited activities on a *Standard Visitor Visa* (tourist visa).  \n  *Source:* UK Home Office / GOV.UK official immigration pages.  \n- Whether any exceptions exist that allow limited work (e.g., business meetings, academic research, volunteering) on a tourist visa.  \n  *Source:* GOV.UK \u201cVisit the UK as a Standard Visitor\u201d guidance.  \n- Legal pathways for short-term work in the UK (e.g., Temporary Worker visa, Youth Mobility Scheme, Seasonal Worker visa).  \n  *Source:* GOV.UK \u201cWork in the UK\u201d visa categories.  \n- Penalties or legal consequences for working illegally while on a tourist visa.  \n  *Source:* UK Immigration Act 2016, Home Office enforcement guidance, UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) policy documents.  \n\n**3. FACTS TO DERIVE**  \n- Logical comparison between what is *permitted* on a tourist visa and what constitutes *work* under UK law.  \n- Determination of whether any legal route exists to perform paid or unpaid work for two months without violating visa conditions.  \n- Assessment of alternative legal options (e.g., switching visa categories before travel).  \n\n**4. EDUCATED GUESSES**  \n- It is almost certain that working (paid or unpaid) on a UK tourist visa is prohibited.  \n- The only permissible activities are likely to be tourism, short business meetings, or academic visits without direct employment.  \n- Attempting to work on a tourist visa would likely result in visa cancellation, fines, deportation, or future entry bans.  \n- The only legal way to work for two months would be to obtain a visa that explicitly allows short-term employment.  \n\n---\n\n### **Plan**\n\n- **web_surfer:** Retrieve the latest official UK government guidance on Standard Visitor Visa restrictions and permitted activities.  \n- **web_surfer:** Gather information on short-term work visa options (Temporary Worker, Youth Mobility, Seasonal Worker).  \n- **file_surfer:** Cross-check retrieved data with secondary reputable sources (e.g., UK immigration law firms, major news outlets).  \n- **coder:** Summarize and synthesize the findings into a concise, reliable overview.  \n- **tool_user_agent:** Verify that all cited information aligns with official UK immigration policy and does not promote illegal activity.  \n- **computer_terminal:** Compile the final summary emphasizing legal alternatives to working on a tourist visa."
