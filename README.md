Placeholder Reversal Demo
- Purpose: A minimal, safety-focused demonstration using only non-identifying placeholders. It prints each placeholder and its reversed string.
- Non-identifying: Contains no real drug names, PHI, or identifying information. It is not part of clinical decision-making and should not be used in workflows involving real care plans.
- Usage: 
  - Run with Python 3: python3 placeholder_reverse_demo.py
- Output: The script prints 10 lines, each in the format "SAFE_TERM_X -> reversed_string".
